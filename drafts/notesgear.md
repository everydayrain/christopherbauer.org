##Accumulation and the Purity of Backpacking Light

When visit those corners of the internet given over to discussing equipment for outdoor pursuits as I do, it can begin to seem self-evidently true that people's interest in gear  can be expalined by pragmatism. (and by people I mean those with disposable income because backpacking is for the most part the sport of the materially comfortable, though it doesn't have to be) People who research backpacking gear are itnerested in finding what works.  This is more than a raw "it works or it doesn't," sort of pragmatism (something itself which is more complicated than it appears if we place it in local historical contexts), but can be a matter of life and limb.  Forum users are continually creating posts with questions, inquiring if a jacket will keep them dry, if a sleeping bag will keep them warm, or a tent can operate in certain environmental conditions.  There is a saying among outdoor communities of many stripes that "cotton kills," for example.  Bring the  wrong gear, and it might get you in much more trouble than you bargained for.  

But I suspect that this isn't the whole of why these corners of the internet have such followings.

Then there is a segment of ultralight backpackers, not all of them by any means, which is interested in aligning a light base weight with a philosophy of independence from material goods.  One byproduct of this belief seems to be that the iterative upgrade cycle of contemporary gear production for depthy markets in the U.S. and elsewhere is largely beside the point.  These folk seek to regulate

But nothing make material objects innately irresistable.  Not all of us are dupes.  And what about those of us.

Environmentalism is a point well taken about the consumer economy, though I don't think that capitalist production of equipment and a person's mental and material investment in gear are so easily distinguished.  The claim that we can get by with less is probably true, but it misses the point of gear "geeks."  

Having the latest piece of gear is also a marker of status, even if the owner doesn't explicitly uphold such status.
