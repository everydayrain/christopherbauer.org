The question of desire as well as fear becomes most crucial in rethinking the kind of reality the state might be acquiring at this moment of globalization, not only of capital, services, and culture but also of security operations and states of emergency.  The question of subjectivity emerges as critical in a variety of ways. On the one hand, there are the subjective dynamics that link people to states, something that Weber already pointed out; on the other hand is what one would call the subjectivity of the state being (Taussig 1992, 1997). How does it become a social subject in everyday life? This is to ask about bodily excitations and sensualities, powerful identifications, and unconscious desires of state officials (Aretxaga 2000a, 2001a); about performances and public representations of statehood; and about discourses, narratives, and fantasies generated around the idea of the state. (Aretxaga 2003, 395)

Hi, I'm Chris. 

The loose theme of this blog has to do with my interests in how representational cultural practices interact with states and politics.  In my studies this had less to do with representation thought of as (something like artistic media), than the notion of performance as a way to understand daily life and experience.  Such commonplace enacted forms of social knowledge were vitally important at my fieldsite as a cultivated form of self-protection, identity, and expression in a post-colonial context.

It is a loose theme because this is a personal blog, and as a personal blog I plan to write about my range of interests.  I'm trained as an anthropologist, and so I think like an anthropologist.  But I also have hobbies and like to talk about politics as anyone else would.



Generally, this flows from a tradition of work over the past four decades which reintroduced social relations into how we think about what states are and how they persist.

How acts not typically thought of as "theatrical" or "performative," nevertheless represented and "made sensible" ways of knowing and being which were otherwise not implicit in the operation of power through arrangements of institutions or legislation governing the action of democracy.

“explicitly blend their lived experience into a political view of social relations, into what I call a political experience, the experience of an engagement to change the world in which they live from a particular social position” (Aretxaga 1997:8)

 In 2019 I earned my PhD in cultural anthropology from Rutgers University.  I studied.

In 2009 I earned an M.A. in Conflict Management from the School of Advanced International Studies at Johns Hopkins University.  

My dissertation is published with ProQuest dissertations and theses.  Or you can find it filed in [Rutgers' archive] (https://doi.org/doi:10.7282/t3-zkh7-ab91).



I built this website using Jekyll and Github pages.  Because I don't have a background in computer science, it will perhaps appear inelegant to the trained eye.  Still, it has been fun learning and building along the way (for the most part).  I will endeavor to keep this site free of ads and trackers to the extent that such a goal is within my control and range of abilities.
