Klara and The Sun - This is my second time reading one of Ishiguro's works.  Previously, I read *The Buried Giant*, and found that book downright puzzling.  The reason I found it puzzling I think was by design, Ishiguro seems to be intent on frustrating reader expectations, subverting conventional structures.  In both novels it is clear you are in the hands of a literary master.  He expertly, and patiently, seduces you into caring for average-in-just-about-every-way protagonists.  

Narrative arc however seems to be a latter note however in Ishiguro's works.  I expected the narrative to come to a certain kind of climax, if not a clear conclusion.  Without one, I couldn't  be sure of what I had read.  Though there are many nuanced insights in Klara and the Sun, I'm beginning to grasp that Ishiguro is deliberately choosing to subvert a conventional narrative structure in exchange for a "singular, lightly formal diction."   With this, he slowly but shurely builds on his consistent dedication to to the themes of memory and obsolescence.  Yes, there is of course an Ishiguro-like narrative surpise, one that is intimated at though never openly discussed.  And he is masterful at building foreboding, and deeping our care for robot characters (though this is because they don't act like robots in any typical way think about robots, [but are in fact more people-like](https://www.lrb.co.uk/the-paper/v43/n06/thomas-jones/oh-you-darling-robot)).

There are intimations here of ritual and religious practice, though I find them a bit banal.
