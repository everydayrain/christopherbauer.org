***Tyll*** by Daniel Kehlmann - This book was a terrific change from my usual literary diet, and I loved it.  Since graduating from anthropology, I've been drawn to history.  In part history's draw for me is the same as that in ethnography, of a desire to know how other people see the world differently, of what their lives were like.  As John Lanchaster put it reading history makes it possible ["that by stretching out our imagination and empathy in time, we can connect with these people,"](https://www.lrb.co.uk/the-paper/v42/n24/john-lanchester/twenty-types-of-human) and glimpse their lives. Hilary Matnel's books, along with Mary XXX's SPQR, were fascinating, and I always especially enjoyed the ethnographic details even if I always wished there were more.  Tyll satisfied that impulse and brought humor to the equation in spades.

Several critics in reviews  used the term picaresque when referring to this style of book, though I think Anthony Cummins [got it right](https://www.theguardian.com/books/2020/feb/18/tyll-daniel-kehlmann-review) when he suggested Kehlmann's work is partly picaresque and partly an absurdist take on the politicking of the thirty years' war.  The tragicomic dimension to elites' decision-making and lives is fantastic.  Tyll represents a kind of chaotic absurdity, and though we delve into his origins, it is this representation, embodied in the high politicking going on among “serious” people, that makes up much of this book.  Kehlmann's work reminds me generally that the carnavelesque, a la Bahktin or XXX, at least in a classical sense, isn't something we see much of in the U.S. (though there might be an argument for analogues like in political satire).
