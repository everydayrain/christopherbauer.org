Mr. Penumbra's (INCLUDES SPOILERS):

Based purely on the narrow consideration of the author's talent for storytelling have I been persuaded that I like this book.  

Having said that, it is a bit bizarre to read this book, created at a slightly more techno-optimistic time in U.S. history, in the context of 2020.  Which is not to say that the author was optimistic about technology.  On the contrary, its one of the paradoxes of reading MR P in 2020 that the author is clearly grappling with the problems of the U.S. tech industry.  The idea the author grapples with revolves around the threat digitization and search pose to knowledge traditionally derived in literary forms.  And yet, a consideration of this problem seems almost quaint by the standards of trolling, context-collapse,  surveillance capitalism, and the anti-trust debates roiling popular media today.  Sure, the author wanted to explore tech's challenges, and yet somehow made a book that in the short run anyway, history may deem to be wildly optimistic.

I wonder if the author sensed, even at the time of writing, that a fully-fledged employment for the protagonists in the .  Consultancy seems a bit of a hedge, as thought the protagonists could have a "happy ending" in tech without its liabilities as freelancers.  In the context of 2020, the socio-cultural status of success with that employment position seems a little absurd, even if it would be the economically sound thing to do.  All I can say was that following a sect of secret bookmakers was diverting for a time.



Piranesi - I'm especially drawn to works whose main character identifies as part of a group that is often disregarded or derided.  *Ka* by XXX, is an underrated book generally though it serves as an example of the genre.   The protagonist -- a crow -- belongs to a species that seems generally ignored by humans at best and actively pursecuted at worst.  *Ka* also had a generational aspect going for it, a genre which I've come to love ever since I first picked up *100 Years of Solitude* by XXX.  *Ka* was a triple threat then, combining generational change, fantasy and an underdog for a protagonist.  

Piranesi is much like Ka in those later two cases with a protagonist whose humility and disinclination to "progress" is a point departure as well as a fascinating space to explore.  Even Piranesi's speech seems antiquated somehow: if I wrote in this language in academia, I'm sure I would have heard about how fusty my writing was from everyone on my committee.  Its a delight however to hear it in an otherwordly character 

The ending, which I won't spoil, was a small letdown.  It had none of the wonder or questions of the house or Piranesi's identity, and the loose ends are tied up in an almost hum-drum way.

Between this work, The Seven Deaths of Evelyn Hardcastle, and Mr. Penumbra's 24-Hour Bookstore, I'm left with vague inklings of desolation when it comes to sticking the landing that is a book ending.
