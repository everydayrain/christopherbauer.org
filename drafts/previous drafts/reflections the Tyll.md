### Books

Tyll by Daniel Kehlmann. This book was a terrific change from my usual literary diet.  Since graduating from anthropology, I've been drawn to history.  In part history's draw for me is the same as that in ethnography, of a desire to know how other people see the world differently, of what their lives were like.  As John Lanchaster put it reading history makes it possible ["that by stretching out our imagination and empathy in time, we can connect with these people,"](https://www.lrb.co.uk/the-paper/v42/n24/john-lanchester/twenty-types-of-human) and glimpse their lives. Hilary Matnel's books, along with Mary XXX's SPQR, were fascinating, and I always especially enjoyed the ethnographic details even if I always wished there were more.  Tyll satisfied that impulse and brought humor to the equation in spades.

Several critics in reviews  used the term picaresque when referring to this style of book, though I think Anthony Cummins [got it right](https://www.theguardian.com/books/2020/feb/18/tyll-daniel-kehlmann-review) when he suggested Kehlmann's work is partly picaresque and partly an absurdist take on the politicking of the thirty years' war.  The tragicomic dimension to elites' decision-making and lives is fantastic.  Tyll represents a kind of chaotic absurdity, and though we delve into his origins, it is this representation, embodied in the high politicking going on among “serious” people, that makes up much of this book.  Kehlmann's work reminds me generally that the carnavelesque, a la Bahktin or XXX, at least in a classical sense, isn't something we see much of in the U.S. (though there might be an argument for analogues like in political satire).

The Seven Deaths of Evelyn Hardcastle.  Whew, this book reeled me in like an unsuspecting catfish.  Its a difficult book to distill without spoilers because you dive into a realistic but fantastical world and intricate narrative structure straight away.  One way to start is on the familiar tropes.  It is a murder mystery.  It is a British great house-style murder mystery, though it doesn't gloss over violence or cruelty.  The familiar territory ends there, as it also has elements of fantasy.  But it doesn't read like a typical fantasy novel.

The Silence by Don Delillo.  I'm a late comer to Delillo's work.  Never read White Noise nor many of his other books.  In 2016 I picked up Zero K and I became an instant fan.  I haven't read many books more than once, but I'd give Zero K a nod to the list of Gabriel Garcia Marquez, Antonio Di Benedetto, and Cormac McCarthy.



I probably don't need to say anything about his talent.  Its not news, but he's gifted at integrating complex ideas into otherwise natural sounding conversations or character progression.  Though I find it difficult to say much about this book and that was because it is really short: XXX pages.  It touches on a number of ideas, one of the most fascinating of which is that the end of technology is a kind of cultural death but seems to stop before it really gets going.  I don't really buy that premise, because plenty of people are not dependent upon technology, and because it is too totalizing to equate the vastness of cultural practices with such a narrow domain of human action as technology.  However the idea did get me thinking about the extent to which social media is an American cultural phenomena.
