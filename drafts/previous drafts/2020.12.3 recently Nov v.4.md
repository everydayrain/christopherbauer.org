title: Reflections

Many apologies for the scarcity of posts.  Our family faced a number of personal challenges over the past few months, not least of which included getting me back into the job market.  Its been a busy time, so here is a reflections post on some reading and hiking I've done since I last posted.

### Books

***Mr. Penumbra's 24-Hour Bookstore*** by Robin Sloan *(INCLUDES SPOILERS)*.  Based purely on the narrow perspective of the author's talent for storytelling, one can be easily persuaded to like this book.  The first half was uncomplicated and comfortable, easy to slip into like a pair of worn slippers.  Sloan is skilled at conveying lots of atmosphere in straightforward writing, a remarkable talent.  And it is one that I'm sure is not easy to acquire.  As a testimony to that skill, I only realized about half way through the book that I didn't know that much about the narrator.  We learn nothing about his appearance or even all that much about his background.  

Having said all of that, it is a bit bizarre to read this book in the context of 2020.  It was created at a *slightly* more techno-optimistic point in U.S. history (early 2010s).  Though the author wasn't exactly paying homage to technology in writing this book, its one of the paradoxes of reading *Mr. Penumbra's 24-Hour Bookstore* in 2020 that Sloan writes through ideas that seem remote and abstracted from the practical challenges we face now.  Sloan is clearly grappling with the growing pains of digitization and mass internet communications.  One idea revolves around the threat digitization and internet search pose to "knowledge," as had been derived from textual media since the advent of the printing-press.  Sloan's dramatic exploration of this idea is fine as far as it goes, but it is a meditation that seems almost quaint by the standards of trolling, context-collapse,  surveillance capitalism, and the anti-trust debates roiling our headlines today.  Sloan made a book which set out to explore tech's challenges, but somehow ended up, in the short run anyway, to be unrealistically optimistic by today's standards.

In the second half of the book I began to flag a bit, though the story moved reasonably well. In a theme to this post the conclusion let Sloan down: the storytelling grew comfortless.  Spoiler - the main characters set up their own consultancy straddling the tech and textual worlds as a somewhat "happy ending."  This felt rather pat and gave a feeling not of the possibilities opened by the first half of the book -- for example of the awe and wonder upon visiting the bookstore -- but rather of a "successful," though entirely routine, life specific to the tech industry in San Francisco.  I wonder if the author sensed, even at the time of writing, that a fully-fledged employment for the protagonists in the tech industry might have seemed like a bridge too far.  Consultancy seems a bit of a hedge, as thought the protagonists could obtain a successful "happy ending" in tech without its liabilities as freelancers.  

Regardless, in the context of 2020 there is something a tad absurd about viewing consultants to the big tech firms as "successful" at a socio-cultural level, even if their success economically aligns with "the American dream."  As I say, its a curious ending as I'm left wondering how that fictional aspiration might sit with Americans today (or even in 2014).  Sure it sounds good, but how accessable was/is it?  Regardless, following a secret sect of bookmakers was diverting for a time.

***The Seven Deaths of Evelyn Hardcastle*** by Stuart Turton - whew, this had me all in from page one.  The hook of this book -- an amnesiatic man, lost in a forest, stained with blood -- was totally convincing.  

Fantasy meets big-house murder mystery, with a hardnosed social eye and violence to boot.  

***Piranesi*** by Susanna Clarke -  This was a wonderful, though too short, work.  I'm especially drawn to Scifi and Fantasy works whose main character identifies as part of a group that is often disregarded or derided.  *Ka* by John Crowley leaps to mind as an example.  Crowley's book is underrated and the protagonist -- a crow -- belongs to a species that is generally ignored by humans at best and actively persecuted at worst.  *Piranesi* is much like *Ka* with a protagonist whose humility and disinclination to "progress" (i.e. modernity understood narrowly as a denaturalizing cultural logic) is a point departure as well as a fascinating socio-psychological space to explore.  Even Piranesi's speech seems antiquated somehow: if I wrote in this language when I was academia, I'm sure I would have heard about how fusty my writing was from everyone on my committee.  Its a delight however to hear it in an otherworldly character.

*Ka* also had a generational aspect going for it, a genre which I've come to love ever since I first picked up *100 Years of Solitude* by XXX.  *Ka* was a triple threat then, combining generational change, fantasy and an underdog for a protagonist.  

The ending, which I won't spoil, was a bit of a letdown.  It had none of the wonder of the house, or questions as to Piranesi's identity, as the first 2/3rds of the book.  Its loose ends are tied up in an exciting though routine.  The confrontation with a human evil is relatively humdrum compared to the scales of the world Clarke creates inside the house, a setting so suggestive of our history and natural environment that if she had tied this ordinary human story back into the stakes of the house, it could have made a powerful ending suggestive of our own place in reality.  Between this work, The Seven Deaths of Evelyn Hardcastle, and Mr. Penumbra's 24-Hour Bookstore, I'm left with vague inklings of desolation when it comes to sticking the landing that is a book ending.   

### Hikes 

In September I completed a monster (for me anyway) hike from Steven's Pass out to Chain Lakes.  This was my first time hiking in the Steven's Pass area of the Alpine Lakes Wilderness.  What can I say?  Believe the hype.  Starting at Steven's Pass I hiked about 10 miles and 3,900 feet along the PCT to Josephine Lake, and from there along the Icicle Creek Trail to the Chain Lakes Spur. Beyond Josephine lake the trail dropped into a small overgrown valley which had the occasional vale of wildflowers but for the most part was a tad overgrown and not much to look at.  The grade on the spur trail up to Chain Lakes was formidable.

The section on the PCT was delightful, and mostly easy going.  Lake Susan Jane was a lovely stop, and probably my favorite lake of the trip.  I think what I liked most was that it was an accessible pocket lake, nestled up into the mountains.  Didn't hurt that the light was terrific when I got there.  Dragon flies lazily passing by and fish nipping at the surface.  A delight.

By the time I reached chain lakes, I was so tired that I didn't really explore much for photos in the afternoon.  Unfortunately, the next morning I woke up in a cloud.  Because my schedule was tight I had to leave before the mist lifted and I could take more photos.  So all I have of the chain lakes in sun are some snaps from my phone while I was eating dinner:
