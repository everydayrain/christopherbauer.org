Our family has moved!  My blog has been quiet lately because back in march we moved to a new home in West Seattle.  We're really pleased to be here, though there is a list of projects as long as my arm to do.  In short

This was my first trip to the Gifford Pinchot National Forest and the Goat Mountain/Green River area.  What a stunning place, I'm an instant fan.
