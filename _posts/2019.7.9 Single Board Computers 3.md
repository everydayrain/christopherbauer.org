#3rd Raspberry PI: Motioneye

For my second board, I started with a Raspberry Pi Zero W to install [Motioneye](https://github.com/ccrisan/motioneye/wiki).  Motioneye is another terrific piece of work that allows you to create a CCTV style camera recording system.  I use mine as a daytime record of my front porch area

The V.2 camera + motion did pick up some fireworks set off down the street at night though.



At this point however, I have no plans for my next project.  While I love the RPIs, 3 seems like plenty.  It might be more worthwhile for me to learn how to have a single Raspberry PI perform more of the functions of these three combined, which I would probably understand were I not self-taught.
