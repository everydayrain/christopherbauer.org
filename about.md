Hi, I'm Chris. 

In 2019 I earned my Ph.D. in cultural anthropology from Rutgers University.  I studied how indigenous groups and Internally Displaced Persons (IDPs) struggled for democratic representation in Peru.

I have recently begun a new phase in my career and I will be using this blog to explore my interests at intersection between Information Security and Cultural Anthropology.  This blog will offer discussion and showcase some of my hobby projects.

My dissertation is published with ProQuest dissertations and theses.  You can also find it filed in [Rutgers' archive](https://doi.org/doi:10.7282/t3-zkh7-ab91).  Prior to my time at Rutgers I earned an M.A. in Conflict Management in 2009 from the School of Advanced International Studies at Johns Hopkins University. 

I built this website using Jekyll and Github pages.  When I started, I didn't have a software engineering background so the site will perhaps appear inelegant to someone with a trained eye.  Still, it has been fun learning and building along the way.  I will endeavor to keep this site free of ads and trackers to the extent that such goals are within my control and abilities.
